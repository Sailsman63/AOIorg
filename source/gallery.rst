I used skinning to create the body and fins. Basically I created several
cross-sections of the fish with the splining tool, and then skinned across
them with the skinning tool. Same for the fins. The spines of the fins are
a bump-mapped texture. The scales are actually a displaced texture. I
straightened the scales and spines using UV mapping. I also used layer
parameters on the textures to vary colors and height of displacement. A
few subtle touches include the debris in the water which is just some
transparent planes with specks on them, and the variable light from above
which is done with a translucent textured plane between the light and the
scene. The plants were created with XFrog from which AOI easily imports models.

My first AoI render, but I spent a lot of time on it. The skull is an
imported obj file that I got off the internet, but the rest is by me. Lots
of interesting textures. Did cloth by randomizing points on a mesh and
then stretching it out mostly in one direction. I've recently made some
improvements with the grape textures and material and added a grape stem
made with Forester.
